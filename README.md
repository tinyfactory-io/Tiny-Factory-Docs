# Tiny Factory Docs

This repo is a collection of engineering and design docs we use at TinyFactory.  They span a large array of topics including: 

- System Engineering - Node.js
- Infrastructure Setup - AWS, EC2, Git
- Interface Engineering - Sencha Touch
- Design

We have put together a pretty interface to make it easier to browse:

[http://docs.tinyfactory.io](http://docs.tinyfactory.io)

These docs are collaborative.  If you see an issue, by all means point it out to us or ask for write access to help fix it.  We are easy to get ahold of via Twitter [@TinyFactorySD](http://www.twitter.com/TinyFactorySD) or via e-mail, [hello@tinyfactory.io](mailto:hello@tinyfactory.io).
